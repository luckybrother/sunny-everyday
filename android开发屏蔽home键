  重写onAttachedToWindow();

public void onAttachedToWindow() {  
  this.getWindow().setType(WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_KEYGUARD);  
  super.onAttachedToWindow();  
} 

然后重写onKeyDown即可
public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {  
  if(keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_HOME) {  
  //
  }  
  return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);  
}  
google 对onAttachedToWindow()的描述
  This is called when the view is attached to a window. At this point it has a Surface and will start drawing. 
  Note that this function is guaranteed to be called before View.onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas), however it may be 
  called any time before the first onDraw -- including before or after View.onMeasure(int, int).
  
  
  如果是屏蔽dialog风格的activity的home键功能的话
  需setType(WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_KEYGUARD_Dialog);  如若不然，dailog风格的activity背景色将变为黑色
